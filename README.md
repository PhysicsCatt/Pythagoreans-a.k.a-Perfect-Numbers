# Perfect Numbers


According to ancient philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, the perfect numbers are the numbers whose divisors(except for that number itself) add up exactly to the number itself. I came across this concept while reading 'Fermat's Last Theorem" boo by Simon Singh. While I was reading I thought it would be easy, fun and interesting to write a programme that can return me the perfect numbers from 1 to some number. Originally, I wanted to get the first 5 perfect numbers: 6, 28, 496, 8128 and 33550336. Ancient Greeks managed to calculate the first 4.

However, my programme took a significant time after the 4th number, that's why I added a timing feature to know how long it would take to obtain the prefect number from 1 to 100000000. Unfortunately, I had to give this idea up because it took a long time and my computer started to overheat. So I settled to find the perfect numbers from 1 to 10000. MMy code took 6 to 6.5 seconds to run to my shock. I normally don't get this different times between runs.
I suspect I can manage to make this calculation faster by using Fortrran95, my favourite programming language. In the future, I'll try to implement this code in Fortran.

In the end, it was silly for me to think I could do better than Pythagoras himself, even when the technology was by my side!
