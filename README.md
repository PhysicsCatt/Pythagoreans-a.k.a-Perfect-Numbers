According to ancient phylosopher and matematician Pythagoras, the perfect numbers are the numbers are those whose divisors(except for itself) add up exactly to the number itself.
I cameacross with this concept while reading 'Fermat's Last Theorem" boo by Simon Singh. While I was reading I thought it woulld be easy, fun and interesting to wrrite a programme that can
return me the prefect numberr from 1 to some number. Originally, I wanted to get the first 5 perfect numbers: 6, 28, 496, 8128 and 33550336. Ancient Greeks managed to calculate the first 4.

However, my programme took a significant time after the 4th number, that's why I added timing feature to know how long it would take to obtain the prefect number from 1 to 100000000. Unfortunately, I had to give this idea up
because it took a long time and my computer started to overheat. So I settled to find the perfect numbers from 1 to 10000. MMy code took 6 to 6.5 seconds to run to my shock. I normally don't get this different times betweeen runs.

I believe I might manage to make this calculation faster by using Fortrran95, my favourite programming langues. In the future, I'll try to impllement this same code in fortrran.

At the end, it was silly for me to thhink I can do better than Pythagorars himself even with technology by my side!
